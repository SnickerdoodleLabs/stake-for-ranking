\section{Abstract}

This work proposes \textit{stake for ranking}, a cryptoeconomic primitive that introduces a token mechanic to content-based recommender systems. Imparting an economic cost and high degree of content authorship traceability increases the robustness of recommender systems to sybil and spoofing attacks. Additionally, end user privacy is greatly enhanced due to data availability through decentralized content distribution networks.
