\section{Conclusions}

Stake for ranking represents a novel cryto
End users can calculate recommendations based on only their local state and on-chain rankings, data-leakage can be prevented through the use of content-addressable networks like Arweave or IPFS. Thus Stake for Ranking is highly scalable
Doesn’t suffer from cold start problem that collaborative filtering systems have
Traditionally, content-based recommender systems suffer from the need for hand-engineering feature representation. This is handled by the economic primitive itself. Content authors are incentivized to curate their feature vector accurately
Traditional content-based recommender systems struggle to extrapolate a user’s interests outside the data available in the user state history. This can be mitigated in the stake for ranking setting by introducing decentralized collaborative filtering algorithms to augment
