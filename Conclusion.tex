\section{Conclusions}

Stake for ranking represents a novel crytoeconomic primitive that brings tokenized economic markets to the field of recommender systems. Staking of economic value in order to enter the recommeder system mitigates the effectiveness of sybil attacks and incentivizes content authors to accurately represent their listings in order to connect with appropriate end users. End users can calculate recommendations based on only their local state and on-chain rankings; data-leakage of end user preferences can be prevented through the use of content-addressable networks like Arweave or IPFS. Content can be associated with known business domains via ERC-7529 leading to increased resilience against spoofing while also making smart contracts easier to search for.
