\section{Conclusions}
This paper has discussed the current data economy, what is wrong with it, and how the Snickerdoodle Protocol aims to flip the power of the economy by allowing individuals to control their own data. The Snickerdoodle Protocol allows individuals to collect, store, and share their data through the use of a data wallet. The protocol allows allows businesses who are getting value of analyzing data to continue to do so by spending Doodles and without having to worry about the legal, technical, and ethical hurdles of storing and using people's data. The Snickerdoodle Protocol will be controlled by the Snickerdoodle DAO which will create a decentralized system of governance that allows the protocol to improve over time and survive without being completely controlled by Snickerdoodle Labs. These changes can help further improve the protocol's functionality and data safety guarantees.
